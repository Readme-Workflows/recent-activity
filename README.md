## Settings

All available settings can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Readme-Workflows/recent-activity/wiki/Configuration).

### Placeholders

The following placeholders may be used in the settings, if the `Supported Placeholders` section lists them.

**Important Notes:**

- Each placeholder with exception of `{DATE}` will turn into an embedded link pointing to the issue, pull request or discussion of that respective action.  
  For example will `{ID}` turn into `[#:id](:url)` and `{URL}` turns into `[:url_text](:url)`.
- Using `{ID}` or `{REPO}` in the `URL_TEXT` setting won't turn them into embedded links. `{ID}` will still have a `#` before it.
